## File: canada_per_capita_income.csv

**Summary:**
This dataset contains yearly per capita income data for Canada. It has 47 rows and 2 columns ('year' and 'per capita income (US$)'). There are no missing values or duplicate rows.

**Data Quality Suggestions:**

1.  **Column Naming:** Consider renaming 'per capita income (US$)' to 'per_capita_income_usd' for better readability and to adhere to common naming conventions.
2.  **Currency Considerations:** The income is in USD. If the original data was in Canadian dollars, specify the conversion rate used.
3.  **Inflation Adjustment:** Consider adjusting the per capita income for inflation to provide a more accurate view of income growth over time.
4.  **Data Source:** Include the source of the data for transparency and verification purposes.
5. **Year Range:** Verify the starting year for relevance for current analysis.

## File: diabetes.csv

**Summary:**
This dataset contains diabetes-related information for 768 patients. It has 9 columns, including features like 'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'BMI', and the target variable 'Outcome'. There are no missing values or duplicate rows. Many features include 0 as a value, which is unlikely (e.g., 0 Glucose or BloodPressure).

**Data Quality Suggestions:**

1.  **Zero Values:** The dataset contains zero values in columns like 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', and 'BMI'. These are likely placeholder values or missing data. Investigate and consider replacing these with appropriate imputation methods (e.g., mean, median) or removing rows with these invalid values.
2.  **Outlier Handling:** The dataset contains outliers in several columns (e.g., 'Pregnancies', 'BloodPressure', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age'). Consider using outlier detection techniques (e.g., IQR method, Z-score) and handle these outliers appropriately (e.g., capping, trimming, transformation).
3.  **Feature Scaling:** Since features have different scales (e.g., 'Glucose' ranges from 0-199, while 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction' ranges from 0.078 to 2.42), consider applying feature scaling techniques (e.g., standardization, normalization) to improve the performance of machine learning models.
4.  **Data Distribution:** Examine the distribution of each feature to understand its characteristics. Consider transformations (e.g., log transformation) for skewed features to improve model performance.
5. **BloodPressure:** Minimum value in BloodPressure is 0. Verify and correct with mean/median values.
6. **Data Imbalance:** Check the class distribution of the 'Outcome' variable. If there's a significant imbalance (e.g., many more non-diabetes cases than diabetes cases), consider using techniques to address class imbalance (e.g., oversampling, undersampling, cost-sensitive learning).
7. **Domain Knowledge:** Consult with domain experts to validate the data and identify potential issues or biases.
8. **Insulin and SkinThickness correlation:** High correlation between Insulin and SkinThickness might be cause of concern.
9. **BloodPressure Outliers:** Significant number of outliers are present in BloodPressure column.
10. **BMI Outliers:** Significant number of outliers are present in BMI column.
